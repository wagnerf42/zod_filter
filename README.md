# zod_filter

This is a small script to tighten clipping in the zod stl tiles
(see [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2528937)) which are quite loose
on my printer.

It works by scaling up the male clips.

Detection of which part to scale is hackish at best.

Scaled up parts will show up as red if your stl viewer displays colors (works in meshlab).
